# Algorithms Practicing

The most powerful use of our programming tools are good algorithms (that is, the process by which you solve a problem with a computer). Today we are going to build up our Python skills along with our algorithm development skills with a few interesting problems.

These problems come from Project Euler, a site that finds interesting intersectional problems between math and computer science. The problems provided in this project are the first three problems they offer (out of over 800 problems).

Complete the problems in the following order based on their difficulty:
1. three-five.py
2. even-fibonacci.py
3. prime-factors.py

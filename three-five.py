# Go through the first 1,000 integers (starting at 0, ending at 999), and
# determine which of them are multiples of 3 or are multiples of 5.

# Remember, 'or' means that it could be a multiple of both 3 and 5!

# As a final answer, print out the sum (adding together) all of the numbers
# that you found were multiples of 3 or 5. See 'answers.txt' for how I
# expect your final output to be formatted.

# Tips:
# - Use range() to go through the integers with a loop.
# - When the remainder from division (%) by a number is 0, then you have a 
#   multiple of that number.

# Example for smaller set:
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
# we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
